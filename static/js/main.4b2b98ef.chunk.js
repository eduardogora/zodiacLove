This can create a problem; Taurus loves to be wooed and romanced \u2014 two concepts that are basically foreign to straightforward, brash, totally unsubtle Aries. An Aries-Taurus partnership can be a great learning experience for both Signs.

Aries\u2019s independent, pioneering spirit is attractive to Gemini, who also values independence. If Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling or if Aries takes Gemini\u2019s flirtatious nature too seriously, arguments may set the tone of the relationship.

Aries can certainly be emotional \u2014 in a fiery, impetuous way that can completely overwhelm Cancer. Even though Cancer usually likes to take time with relationships, Aries\u2019s whirlwind approach can be extremely stimulating. Aries, on the other hand, may find the Cancerian sensitivity appealing; it\u2019s a good balance for the typical Aries bluntness. Troubles may arise if Cancer\u2019s mood swings or Aries\u2019s aggression becomes hurtful.

Aries and Virgo can seem like total opposites: While Aries is brash, dominant and aggressive, always jumping into new things and almost always impatient, Virgo is detail-oriented and quiet, even shy, and works patiently toward long-term goals. Aries\u2019s energy is fiery and impetuous while Virgo\u2019s is much slower and more grounded. It\u2019s these very differences, however, that can teach Aries and Virgo so much, once they just look beneath one another\u2019s surfaces to see what lies beneath."},{"current":"Aries","match":"Libra","score":"Excellent","caption":"When Aries and Libra come together in a love affair, the inherent polarity of the Zodiac is invoked.","desc":"Aries and Libra are directly opposite one another in the Zodiac \u2014 180 degrees apart. Each Sign possesses qualities that the other lacks; combined with Libra\u2019s natural yen for harmony, this can be a relationship that enjoys great balance. Aries is the Sign of Self while Libra is the Sign of Partnership, and the differences continue: Aries is impulsive, excitable and ready to jump right into something new and exciting, while Libra is indecisive, peace-loving and prefers a calm, smooth approach. Aries can learn from Libra that their own way isn\u2019t necessarily the best way."},{"current":"Aries","match":"Scorpio","score":"Good","caption":"When Aries and Scorpio come together in a love match, it can be the kind of relationship where they both wonder how they ever managed apart.","desc":"Both Signs love power and they can achieve just about anything \u2014 as long as they learn to share the spotlight.

This relationship is torrid and exciting and both partners are always ready for a new adventure. They both crave life experience of their own and don\u2019t like to waste time just reading about it or listening to others tell about theirs. They do need to be careful, however: This could be an accident-prone relationship as Aries is always in a rush and Sagittarius tends to look at everything but the obvious. Also, as much as these two have in common, it may be difficult to maintain a long-term relationship when both parties have so much energy to start new things \u2014 but not much interest in following through."},{"current":"Aries","match":"Capricorn","score":"Critical","caption":"When Aries and Capricorn come together in a love match, they must work hard to maintain their mutual energy.","desc":"Their approaches can seem almost opposite to one another \u2014 Aries is all about acting without bothering to consider where the action is directed or what it will attain, while Capricorn is all about judging whether (or how much) it will benefit them before they take action. Aries moves fast and, to Capricorn, at least, seems to risk it all. Capricorn abhors unnecessary risk. They move at a slower pace, working inexhaustibly toward well-defined goals (usually related to career or other forms of public advancement).

On the surface an Aries and a Pisces may seem an unlikely pair, but when there\u2019s love involved, they can truly fulfill one another\u2019s needs. Pisces is very intuitive, both as a person and as a lover; Aries must take care to return this favor so Pisces won\u2019t begin to see their Aries partner as stingy and selfish."}],"taurus":[{"current":"Taurus","match":"Aries","score":"Good","caption":"When Aries and Taurus come together in a love affair, the partnership is a natural union of Love, represented by Taurus, and Passion, represented by Aries.","desc":"This relationship is all about balance.

They will spoil one another to both their hearts\u2019 content: Taurus can respect their sweetheart\u2019s desire for life\u2019s little luxuries, because they have that need themselves. Both partners are charming, graceful and dignified. They can be quite stubborn and opinionated, not to mention jealous and possessive.

Gemini\u2019s Symbol is the Twins; this Sign can often be of two minds about things. If possessive Taurus is able to let go and give one Twin the relationship security and intimacy it wants while allowing the other Twin its freedom, things will go well between these two. Taurus may want too much for Gemini\u2019s taste early in the relationship, but Gemini can become dependable and steady \u2014 Taurus must simply be patient."},{"current":"Taurus","match":"Cancer","score":"Excellent","caption":"When Taurus and Cancer come together in a love affair, it\u2019s usually a very good combination.","desc":"They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to share karmic ties and a deep mutual understanding.

While Sagittarius thrives when they\u2019re constantly experiencing new people, places, foods and more, Taurus can be quite content with routine as it affords them the security they so prize. Early in the relationship, Taurus might tend to demand more commitment and stability than Sagittarius is ready to give, but if Taurus can learn to be patient, Sagittarius can definitely come to appreciate the comforts of hearth and home."},{"current":"Taurus","match":"Capricorn","score":"Excellent","caption":"When Taurus and Capricorn come together in a love match, it\u2019s a practical, sensible partnership.","desc":"These two Signs share a certain down-to-earth logic and interest in efficiency. Taurus is not interested in risking more than is necessary in terms of emotional connection and involvement, and Capricorn is similarly disinterested in risk, but more in terms of money and career. Capricorn\u2019s career is one of the great focuses of their lives; they\u2019re interested in scaling the heights and tend to set very high standards for themselves to adhere to.

Others enjoy two Geminis as a couple as well \u2014 they\u2019re sure to be the life of every party with their sharp wit and well-honed entertainment routine.

Gemini is symbolized by the Twins; they can see both sides of a story, they tend to vacillate between two courses of action and sometimes they can seem as if they have a split personality! This relationship is greatly strengthened when steady Virgo provides one Twin with a steady emotional anchor while allowing the other Twin to flit about at will.","desc":"Virgo may be a bit too serious and demanding for Gemini, especially if this occurs early in the relationship before Gemini has fully committed.

Gemini must have freedom to think outside the bounds; they rely on their quick wits, humor and intellectual prowess to move through life at a fast pace. Capricorn is concerned with advancement and status; they rely on following the rules and finding set, tried-and-true paths to follow toward success, no matter how long it takes.

Pisces has the gift of intuitive empathy; they connect very well with others on a rather subtle emotional level, and their dreamy nature makes them quite open-minded \u2014 in short, Pisces expects the unexpected.

Aries moves fast and, to Capricorn, at least, seems to risk it all. Capricorn abhors unnecessary risk. They move at a slower pace, working inexhaustibly toward well-defined goals (usually related to career or other forms of public advancement).
